Welcome to the **Symmetric Key and Lightweight Cryptography Lab** (**SyLLab**) page.

We are part of the *School of Physical and Mathematical Sciences* of **Nanyang Technological University**, Singapore. The lab is led by Prof. Thomas Peyrin and its research scope is cryptography in general, with a special focus on the analysis, design and implementation of symmetric-key primitives (hash functions, block and stream ciphers, MACs, etc) and lightweight cryptography.
